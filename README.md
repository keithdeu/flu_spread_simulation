# File Descriptions

* Pandemic Flu Spread Report.pdf --> The final written report with findings.
* Pandemic Flu Spread Report.docx --> MS word version of the final report. 

* Pandemic_Simulation.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook of the simulation script. This is the intended format for the simulation to be run
* Pandemic_Simulation.py --> py version of the Pandemic_Simulation.ipynb 
* Pandemic_Simulation.html --> HTML version of Pandemic_Simulation.ipynb 
* Pandemic_Simulation.txt --> text version of Pandemic_Simulation.ipynb 

* df_results.xlsx --> the file created when exporting the df pandas dataframe to excel (and further analysis in excel). These results are from running the simulation for 10,000 trials where no students start out with immunity (Imm_50_50 = False in the simulation)
* df_len_results --> the file created when exporting the df_len pandas dataframe to excel (and further analysis in excel). These results are from running the simulation for 10,000 trials where no students start out with immunity (Imm_50_50 = False in the simulation)
* df_50_50_results.xlsx --> the file created when exporting the df pandas dataframe to excel (and further analysis in excel). These results are from running the simulation for 10,000 trials where students have a 50% chance of starting out with immunity (Imm_50_50 = True * in the simulation)
* df_len_50_50_results.xlsx --> the file created when exporting the df_len pandas dataframe to excel (and further analysis in excel). These results are from running the simulation for 10,000 trials where students have a 50% chance of starting out with immunity (Imm_50_50 = True in the simulation)
